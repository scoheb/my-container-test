description: Installs the $JBOSS_HOME/bin/launch/ files to configure JGroups
envs:
- description: Password used to authenticate the node so it is allowed to join the
    JGroups cluster. Required, when using ASYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster traffic encryption
    protocol. If not set, authentication is disabled, cluster communication is not
    encrypted and a warning is issued. Optional, when using SYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster
    traffic encryption protocol.
  example: p@ssw0rd
  name: JGROUPS_CLUSTER_PASSWORD
- description: Name of the keystore file within the secret specified via JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_SECRET
    variable. If it is not set when using SYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster traffic encryption
    protocol, the cluster communication is not encrypted and a warning is issued.
    If it is not set when using ASYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster traffic encryption protocol,
    the cluster communication is encrypted without using Elytron keystore.
  example: jgroups.jceks
  name: JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_KEYSTORE
- description: Optional. A non absolute directory path of the keystore file within
    the secret specified via JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_SECRET variable. If it is not set, then
    the keystore file is relative to the servers ${jboss.server.config.dir}
  example: /etc/jgroups-encrypt-secret-volume
  name: JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_KEYSTORE_DIR
- description: "Name associated with the server\u2019s certificate. If it is not set\
    \ when using SYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster traffic encryption protocol, the cluster\
    \ communication is not encrypted and a warning is issued. If it is not set when\
    \ using ASYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster traffic encryption protocol, the cluster\
    \ communication is encrypted without using Elytron keystore."
  example: jgroups
  name: JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_NAME
- description: Password used to access the keystore and the certificate, when using
    SYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster traffic encryption protocol. If it is not set when
    using SYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster traffic encryption protocol, the cluster communication
    is not encrypted and a warning is issued. If it is not set when using ASYM_ENCRYPT
    JGroups cluster traffic encryption protocol, the cluster communication is encrypted
    without using Elytron keystore.
  example: p@ssw0rd
  name: JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD
- description: JGroups protocol to use for encryption of cluster traffic. Can be either
    SYM_ENCRYPT or ASYM_ENCRYPT. Defaults to SYM_ENCRYPT.
  example: SYM_ENCRYPT
  name: JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_PROTOCOL
- description: Name of the secret, containing the JGroups keystore file used for securing
    the JGroups communications. If it is not set when using SYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster
    traffic encryption protocol, the cluster communication is not encrypted and a
    warning is issued. If it is not set when using ASYM_ENCRYPT JGroups cluster traffic
    encryption protocol, the cluster communication is encrypted without using Elytron
    keystore.
  example: app-secret
  name: JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_SECRET
- description: JGroups protocol to use for node discovery. Can be either openshift.DNS_PING
    or kubernetes.KUBE_PING.
  example: openshift.DNS_PING
  name: JGROUPS_PING_PROTOCOL
