envs:
- description: A comma-separated list of service broker definitions used to connect
    to a remote AMQ broker. It follows the pattern SERVICE-NAME_TYPE=PREFIX where
    type can be 'amq' or 'amq7'.  The type 'amq' will configure the resource-adapters
    subsystem to connect to an external Red Hat AMQ broker system. It is considered
    the legacy configuration. The type 'amq7' will configure the messaging-activemq
    subsystem to connect to an external Red Hat AMQ 7 broker. Multi AMQ7 broker configuration
    is not yet supported. The PREFIX is used to link the configuration with a set
    of environment variables whose name starts with this PREFIX.
  example: my-application_amq7=MY_AMQ
  name: MQ_SERVICE_PREFIX_MAPPING
- description: JNDI name for connection factory used by applications to connect to
    the broker.
  example: java:jboss/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory
  name: '{PREFIX}_JNDI'
- description: 'Broker protocols to configure, separated by commas. Allowed values
    are: `openwire`, `amqp`, `stomp` and `mqtt`. Only `openwire` is supported by EAP.'
  example: openwire
  name: '{PREFIX}_PROTOCOL'
- description: Queue names, separated by commas. These queues will be automatically
    created when the broker starts. Also, they will be made accessible as JNDI resources
    in EAP. Note that all queues used by the application *must* be specified here
    in order to be created automatically on the remote AMQ broker.
  example: HelloWorldMDBQueue
  name: '{PREFIX}_QUEUES'
- description: Topic names, separated by commas. These topics will be automatically
    created when the broker starts. Also, they will be made accessible as JNDI resources
    in EAP. Note that all topics used by the application *must* be specified here
    in order to be created automatically on the remote AMQ broker.
  example: HelloWorldMDBTopic
  name: '{PREFIX}_TOPICS'
- description: User name for standard broker user. It is required for connecting to
    the broker.
  example: UserName
  name: '{PREFIX}_USERNAME'
- description: Password for standard broker user. It is required for connecting to
    the broker.
  example: P@ssw0rd
  name: '{PREFIX}_PASSWORD'
- description: Boolean value which is used only for AMQ type brokers. It defines if
    the resource adapter used to connect to this broker should track connection handles
    across transaction boundaries.
  example: 'true'
  name: '{PREFIX}_TRACKING'
- description: IP of the external Red Hat AMQ 7 broker. It is only relevant if you
    are configuring AMQ7 service brokers.
  example: 10.25.10.30
  name: '{SERVICE-NAME}_AMQ7_TCP_SERVICE_HOST'
- description: Port of the external Red Hat AMQ 7 broker. It is only relevant if you
    are configuring AMQ7 service brokers.
  example: '6556'
  name: '{SERVICE-NAME}_AMQ7_TCP_SERVICE_PORT'
- description: IP of the external Red Hat AMQ broker. It is only relevant if you are
    configuring AMQ service brokers.
  example: 10.25.10.30
  name: '{SERVICE-NAME}_AMQ_TCP_SERVICE_HOST'
- description: Port of the external Red Hat AMQ broker. It is only relevant if you
    are configuring AMQ service brokers.
  example: '6556'
  name: '{SERVICE-NAME}_AMQ_TCP_SERVICE_PORT'
